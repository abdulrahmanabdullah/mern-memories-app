# Motivation

Challenge and motivation are the things which make better a person. I was looking for something advanced and challenge me to raise me in the second level.I found this project on [this channel]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUzmlZfYNg") and I rebuilt it from scratch with using last updated library and added some features like Redux toolkit,i18n,theme provider, sessions and cookies to protect route and passportJS.

## React 18 , Mui library V5 , Redux toolkit , Google Auth SDK , Validation password, Like and unlike post if user authenticated also appears how likes each post, Use Pagination material ui, Use Location,Navigate and prevPath with routes in react-route-dom v6, use ImageListItem Mui to show recommended posts and toggle them mode, toggle direction and change language, Search by tags also by words, Use object state to avoid unnecessary re-renders .

## Express , Mongoe db , Middleware , Post models and User modles.
