# ðŸ˜„ Motivation

Challenge and motivation are the things which make better a person. I was looking for something advanced and challenge me to raise me in the second level.I found this project on [this channel]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUzmlZfYNg") and I **rebuilt it from scratch** with using last updated library and added some features like Redux toolkit,i18n,theme provider, sessions and cookies to protect route and passportJS.
